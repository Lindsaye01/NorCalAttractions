            <p> **If you are a business owner of an little-know, yet really special, attraction looking to have your business featured on this website, please, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.  We are always interested in places that are unique and special!</p>

          <h2 class="question">Why are there so few places written about on this site?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>We are just in the beginning phases of this website. We are writing in earnest, every single weekend, but it takes time to accumulate knowledge.</p>
            <p>In addition, we do our utmost to provide detailed, up-to-date information.  This means we research or subject thoroughly.  Also, we maintain high standards about what it is we do choose to write about, so that we can offer the best experiences possible to our readers.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="question">Do you actually go to the places that you are writing about?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Absolutely!  We would never endorse an attraction without experiencing it first hand.  We strive to write interesting, well-researched, <i>first-hand-experienced</i> articles. In order to do this, we need to go, see and do! This makes our reviews trustworthy.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="question">Why are most your articles about Redding?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>As the largest city north of Sacramento, just off the interstate 5, centrally-locted Redding is the natural place to begin our travels.  It is easy for travelers to find, and Redding's two lakes, one river, and rich Gold Rush history give many informative, historical and nautural attractions from which to choose.</p>
