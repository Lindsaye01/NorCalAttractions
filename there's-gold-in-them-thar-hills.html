    <h2>There’s Gold in Them Thar’ Hills! – Old Shasta City</h2>

    <p>My husband and I usually take our friends from down south  on a tour through this adorable one-road town on the way to Whiskeytown Lake.   We were always on our way to do something else, such as taking our dog for a hike, or a swim, or water skiing on the very nearby Whiskeytown lake.  But with every passing of this quaint, ghost-like town, I would stare out the truck’s window and wonder about all the secrets the ruins of these  once strong, iron-doored, red-brick buildings held deep within their walls.  I could literally feel the town, the people, the bustle of commerce-past as we passed by the shops,  passed the Victorian houses, many of which still held a semblance of their old glory.  There was a blacksmith’s shack still laden with its wares and a the stately courthouse.</p>

    <p>So, on our way up to Whiskeytown lake yesterday,  it was quite a treat  to see an unusual amount of activity taking place on the ramshakle boardwalk that whispers of the memory it's late streets, activity we had never seen before.  The Shasta Historical Society was doing a tour! Now was my opportunity to explore this quaint, bucolic town and learn more about this awesome relic from the Gold Rush days!
    We got Sadie, our German Shepherd,  out of the car and crossed the street to meet Mike.  He was an extremely friendly, informative ombudsman for the Shasta Historical Society, and he gave us so much information that I had to pull out a pen and paper so that I could recount it all </p>

    <p>As I had already assumed, built in 1853, this city was indeed built in answer to that famous yellow metal.  Gold was discovered in Shasta County in 1849, and this sparked the “second coming” of the California gold rush.  Within 6 months, this small area was inundated with men, hauling along and transplanting their entire families, in pursuit of something better.  With over 500 people erecting make-shift homes, it quickly became a veritable tent city.  More entrepreneurial types came in answer to the needs of these families, and Shasta City was

    <p>But it is much more than the the simple “miner town”  I imagined.  Mike informed us that Old Shasta City was, in fact, the major stop for shipping endeavors coming up from the Sacramento River, and that Shasta City was considered one of the most important California towns, right up there with San Francisco and Sacramento, our state capitol.  In order for all the miners and frontiersmen to get their staples, the Sacramento River was travelled upstream from the San Francisco Bay and then the supplies were dumped in Red Bluff because the large boats could no longer continue on the waterway that had became too shallow. Everything was dumped at this juction and then carted by stagecoach the rest of the way here to Shasta City.  It was the major commercial hub for the north, named the “Queen City,” and held its distinction as the county seat.  In the heyday of this magnificent historical site,  it was not unheard of to have over 100 mule trains stop here to unload and upload goods on their way into the mountains to meet with the men searching for gold.</p>

    <p>It was so nice to see the town lively, with children there, learning about history.  The Bakery made cookies and handed them out freely to anyone who had a hankerin’…</p>

    <p>The merchant’s tended their stores, fully dressed in 1850’s merchant’s attire…</p>

    <p>Park Ranger’s held court over a boiling cauldron of bees-wax in front of one of the deserted mine shafts that went deep into the side of the mountain,  where we were allowed to make candles in the style of a candle maker from 1852…  It was heartwarming to watch everyone learning about the process of dipping the “wicks” into the wax and then dipping the growing candle into a cold bucket of water, excitedly watching as the candle grew rotund.</p>

    <p>Even real-life knowledgable blacksmith’s gave lessons in history and blacksmithing as we stopped to gather in all the sights.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately,  Mike also explained that the “Queen City” of the north did not last very long.  When, in 1888, the Central Pacific Railroad connected the city of Redding to the new railroad tracks being laid, it basically cut off Shasta City to this new form of transportation, and the city dwindled into a semi-ghost town.  I use the term “semi-ghost town” because it has never been abandoned.  Adorable Victorian style cottages still stand, with beautifully designed walkways and layered landscaping made from river rock, and are still occupied.  Shasta City now has a population of 1,700 people, although you’d be hard-pressed to find them all, and the old courthouse is used as a museum to an unprecedented collection of early California artwork, donated by the benevolent Mae Helene Bacon Boggs.

    <p>This is a great event for the entire family.

I learned that the courthouse is .

I also learned that the historical society also does a few different events here at this city located on the side of the 299 highway.  But one that sounds particularly interesting is in early May and is a day dedicated to re-enacting part of a book penned by poet Joaquin Miller, Life Amongst the Modocs.  The re-enactment is based on his story of being imprisoned in the Shasta Courthouse for stealing a horse and his subsequent escape with the assistance of his loving wife!  Whoa, Nelly!  Our own version of Bonnie and Clyde! (…without all the violence, as this is “northern” California, land of the kind and friendly…)  The website says that locals are allowed to participate in the story-telling!  Maybe I can wrestle an acting position out of this gig!  Active participant or enthusiastic observer, either way, you can bet I will be there!
One of the nicest aspects of living in northern California is that it never seems to be crowded, anywhere. No matter the occasion, concerts, the freeway at 5:00 p.m., free concerts and art festivals on the river, it is never so crowded that a person feels cramped or stifled.  Every person at this festival had ample opportunities to partake freely in the hands-on learning that was offered.
